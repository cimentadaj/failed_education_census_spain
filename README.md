# Failed education in Spain

This repository hosts the work of a paper exploring failed education in Spain using census data. The repo is named after **f**ailed **e**ducation **spain**.

To reproduce this, you'll need to download the Spanish 2011 census data from [here](https://www.ine.es/censos2011_datos/cen11_datos_microdatos.htm) (click on 'Nacional' after 'Fichero de microdatos' and a download window should appear). Once you download the data, save the file `MicrodatosCP_NV_per_nacional_3VAR.txt` in the `data` folder. Your `data` folder should only have the files `MicrodatosCP_NV_per_nacional_3VAR.txt` and `variable_labels.xls`, which already should be there.

Note that running this analysis requires your computer to have more than 8 GB of RAM as the data is quite heavy. If any errors arise out of lack of memory, you need to run this in a computer with more RAM memory.
