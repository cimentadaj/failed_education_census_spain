# Failed education in Spain

This repository hosts the work of a paper exploring failed education in Spain using census data. The repo is named after **f**ailed **e**ducation **spain**.

To reproduce this, you'll need to download the Spanish 2011 census data from [here](https://www.ine.es/censos2011_datos/cen11_datos_microdatos.htm) (click on 'Nacional' after 'Fichero de microdatos' and a download window should appear). Once you download the data, save the file "MicrodatosCP_NV_per_nacional_3VAR.txt" in the `data` folder. Your `data` folder should only have the files "MicrodatosCP_NV_per_nacional_3VAR.txt" and "variable_labels.xls", which already should be there.
